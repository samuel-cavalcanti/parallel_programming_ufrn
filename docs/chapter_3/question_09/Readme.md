# Quest√£o 9

Write an MPI program that implements multiplication of a vector by a scalar and dot product. The user should enter two vectors and a scalar, all of which are read in by process 0 and distributed among the processes. The results are calculated and collected onto process 0, which prints them. You can assume that $n$, the order of the vectors, is evenly divisible by _comm_sz_
