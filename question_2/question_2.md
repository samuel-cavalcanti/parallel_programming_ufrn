2. We’ve implicitly assumed that each call to **_Compute_next_value_** requires roughly the same amount of work as the other calls. How would you change your answer to the preceding question if call _i_ = _k_ requires _k_ + 1 times as much work as the call with _i_ = 0? So if the first call (_i_ = 0) requires 2 milliseconds, the second call (_i_ = 1) requires 4, the third (_i_ = 2) requires 6, and so on.
